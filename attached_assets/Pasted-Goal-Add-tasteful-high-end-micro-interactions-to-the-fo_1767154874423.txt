Goal:
Add tasteful, high-end micro-interactions to the footer CTA module (“Interested in how I approach platform engineering?”) so it feels more responsive and premium—without being flashy.

Scope

Only update the footer CTA module (the container + the two buttons).

Do not change existing copy, spacing, colors, or CTA hierarchy.

Keep motion subtle, consistent with the site’s dark/blue theme.

Motion + Interaction Requirements
1) CTA container hover (desktop only)

When the user hovers anywhere on the CTA card/container:

Slight lift: translateY(-2px)

Soft shadow increase (or glow increase) using existing brand blue tone

Border highlight becomes a touch brighter

Transition: ~180–220ms, ease-out

Mobile: no hover effects, but keep transitions intact (tap should still feel snappy).

2) Primary button (“Schedule a call”) hover + active

On hover (desktop):

Slight lift: translateY(-1px)

Slight brightness increase (or background lighten by ~3–5%)

Add a subtle focus ring/glow (very soft)

If there is an icon, nudge it right by 2px or rotate 0°→2° (optional)

On active (mouse down / tap):

Press down: translateY(0px) or translateY(1px)

Reduce shadow slightly

3) Secondary button (“Send a note”) hover + active

On hover:

Background fills very lightly (e.g., translucent white/blue overlay)

Border becomes slightly brighter

Tiny lift: translateY(-1px) (optional)

On active:

Press down translateY(0px) or translateY(1px)

4) Visible focus states (keyboard accessibility)

For both buttons:

Add :focus-visible ring using your accent cyan/blue

Should be clear but not thick

Avoid removing outlines without replacement

5) Respect reduced motion

Add a prefers-reduced-motion guard:

Disable transforms and animated transitions

Keep basic color changes

Implementation Notes (What to change)

Locate the component / section that renders the footer CTA module (likely a FooterCTA, CallToAction, or similar).

Add a class to the CTA container (e.g., .footer-cta-card) and to buttons (e.g., .cta-primary, .cta-secondary) if not already present.

Implement styles using your current styling approach:

If Tailwind: use transition, duration-200, ease-out, hover:-translate-y-[1px], etc.

If CSS modules / global CSS: add the hover/focus rules in the appropriate stylesheet.
