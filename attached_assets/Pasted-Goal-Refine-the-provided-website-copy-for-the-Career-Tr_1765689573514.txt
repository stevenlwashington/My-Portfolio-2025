Goal: Refine the provided website copy for the "Career Trajectory & Impact" section to be concise, outcome-driven, and highly appealing to executive recruiters, following a "breadcrumb" strategy.

You are an expert Executive Resume and Product Marketing copywriter. Your task is to apply specific editorial and structural changes to two pieces of content for a website:
1.  **The High-Level Card (The Breadcrumb):** The visible section under the "Career Trajectory & Impact" header.
2.  **The Detailed Case Study (The P-A-R):** The content that appears when the user clicks "View Case Study."

### **Content to Edit:**

**A. High-Level Card (The Breadcrumb):**

**Headline:** Platform Product Lead, Revenue Engineering and AI Platforms
**Company/Dates:** Zillow, 2023–Present
**Metadata:** Led cross-functional teams (DevOps, Salesforce, Security) $\cdot$ 100+ engineers $\cdot$ GTM Platform Engineering
**KEY OUTCOMES:**
* Defined multi-year platform vision and drove architectural shift toward self-service CI/CD—reducing release cycles from days to minutes.
* Secured SVP+ alignment for multi-year modernization initiative through business case development, technical deep dives, and ROI framing; partnered with principal architects on target-state data architecture
* Owned platform TCO strategy including data storage optimization and infrastructure cost efficiency decisions, delivering $450K/yr in annual savings while enabling responsible AI governance at scale
* Invited to speak at Pendomonium 2023 on 'Transforming enterprise technology with product analytics'—recognized as industry thought leader

**B. Detailed Case Study (The P-A-R):**

**P | Problem:** Zillow’s Salesforce engineering teams faced 2-3 day release cycles due to manual deployment processes and lack of CI/CD infrastructure. This created deployment bottlenecks, increased risk, and prevented rapid iteration across revenue-critical GTM features. Meanwhile, 16 years of enterprise data sat fragmented across systems, making it difficult to leverage for AI/ML initiatives.

**A | Action:** I defined the multi-year platform vision and initiated an org-wide architectural shift toward self-service CI/CD. I led the design and implementation of an on-demand CI/CD platform with automated testing pipelines, validation gates, and self-service deployment capabilities. Partnered with principal architects on target-state data architecture. Made critical prioritization tradeoffs between platform reliability, operational cost, and deployment velocity. In parallel, architected enterprise data consolidation pipelines that unified historical data from multiple sources into a clean, AI-ready format with proper governance and audit trails.

**R | Result:** Release cycles dropped from days to minutes, enabling GTM teams to ship features 80% faster. The CI/CD platform became the standard across all Salesforce engineering. Data consolidation enabled new AI training initiatives while reducing data storage costs by $450K annually. Demonstrated platform investments directly accelerate business velocity while managing cost and reliability. Drove executive alignment across Engineering, Security, and GTM on platform roadmap priorities.

**Key Metrics (Retain Exactly As-Is):**
* Release cycle: days → minutes
* Annual savings: $450K
* GTM velocity: +80%
* 100+ engineers enabled

### **Required Changes (Apply these to the content above):**

**1. Refine High-Level Card (The Breadcrumb):**

* **Metadata Update:** Integrate the financial impact into the existing metadata string for a higher executive signal.
    * *New Metadata:* "100+ Eng. $\cdot$ Cross-Functional (DevOps/AI/GTM) $\cdot$ **$450K Annual Savings**"
* **Outcome Reduction:** **Reduce KEY OUTCOMES to a maximum of two (2) bullets** that focus solely on the most impactful metrics and executive drivers (velocity and finance/scale).
    * *Keep and refine the velocity outcome:* Focus on the reduction in cycles.
    * *Keep and refine the TCO/AI outcome:* Focus on the financial savings and strategic enabler.
    * *Remove:* The SVP alignment and Pendomonium bullets (details are too process-oriented for the high-level view).

**2. Refine Detailed Case Study (The P-A-R):**

* **P | Problem:** Slightly rephrase the second sentence for better flow.
* **A | Action:** Slightly adjust the end of the Action section to reduce redundancy and focus on the primary threads.
* **R | Result:** Enhance the final sentence to strongly emphasize the *business* outcome and secured executive buy-in.
* **Key Metrics:** Leave this section **untouched**.

### **Output Format:**

Provide the final, revised content in two distinct blocks, clearly labeled:

**1. Revised High-Level Card (The Breadcrumb)**
**2. Revised Detailed Case Study (The P-A-R)**
