You are working in the stevenwa.com codebase. Update the Career section cards in a LOWER (staging/dev) environment to consolidate metadata and thesis copy into a single subheading per card, with the following corrected revenue figures.

GOALS
- Replace icon-based metadata rows and quoted thesis blocks with ONE unified subheading per card.
- Improve scanability and executive readability while preserving all informational content.
- Apply the same subheading pattern consistently across all Career cards.
- Do NOT change overall layout, card structure, spacing, or interaction behavior.

SCOPE
- Career section only.
- Content and light structural adjustment only (no visual redesign).
- Desktop and mobile behavior must remain consistent with existing design rules.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
1. For each Career card:
   - Remove or hide:
     - Icon-based metadata rows (team size, users, revenue, savings, etc.)
     - Quoted thesis block styling
   - Insert a single subheading text block directly under the role/title.

2. Subheading rules:
   - One paragraph (no bullets, no icons, no quotation marks).
   - Sentence case.
   - Slightly muted text color relative to the role title.
   - Same max-width and alignment as existing card body content.
   - No new borders, cards, or background treatments.

3. Preserve:
   - Existing expand/collapse behavior for “Strategic Questions That Guided My Work” and Outcomes.
   - All analytics tracking (do not rename ids, data attributes, or event handlers).
   - Accessibility and reduced-motion preferences.
