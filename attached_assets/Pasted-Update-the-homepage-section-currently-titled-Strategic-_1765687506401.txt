Update the homepage section currently titled “Strategic Platform Capabilities” (the scroll/reveal section that displays 3 capability cards like “Salesforce Consolidation,” “CI/CD Acceleration,” and “AI Governance at Scale”).

Goal: Reframe this entire section from “Capabilities” to “Use Cases”, tighten the copy for skimmability, expand to exactly 5 use cases, and keep the existing structure/layout (company label + large title + 1-line subheading + metric band + short paragraph). This section should function like a “preview reel” and avoid repeating deeper detail from later sections.

1) Section heading + subheading

Replace:

Heading: Strategic Platform Capabilities

Subheading: Scroll through proven capabilities. Each story reveals as you explore.

With:

Heading: Use Cases

Subheading: A few representative platform initiatives and the outcomes they enabled.

Keep spacing/typography consistent with the current design system.

2) Use case ordering (must be in this exact order)

The 5 use cases should appear in this order:

Salesforce Consolidation

CI/CD Acceleration

AI Governance at Scale

Enterprise Data Archival & AI Enablement

AWS Enterprise Discount Program Enablement

3) Use case content (titles, subheads, metrics, body)

Update each use case card to match the content below exactly. Keep the existing “Zillow” label for the first four items and “AWS” for the last item (or “Amazon Web Services (AWS)” if that label already exists in the UI).

(1) Salesforce Consolidation (Zillow)

4) Implementation notes (important)

If this section is driven by an array/object (e.g., capabilities), rename it to something like useCases and update field names accordingly.

Keep the existing UI pattern (icon + company label + big title + subheading + metric band + paragraph).

Keep the paragraphs tight (no more than 3 sentences each).

Do not add new sub-sections or extra headings.

5) Acceptance criteria

Section title shows Use Cases with the new subheading

Exactly 5 use cases render, in the specified order

Each use case matches the title/subheading/metrics/body exactly

Mobile layout remains readable (no text overflow in metrics band)

No TypeScript errors; build passes
