Update the homepage section directly below the Hero + CTA (currently “What I Solve For” and the “Scope of Ownership” metrics).

Goal: Replace copy, adjust card ordering and titles, update the metrics block to grouped “People & Orgs” and “Systems & Business Impact,” and add a short executive-style quote block beneath the metrics. Keep the existing visual style (dark theme, cards, icons) and ensure the layout is mobile-friendly.

⸻

1) Section header + subtitle

Replace the section title with:
Main Heading: How I Drive Value
Replace the subtitle paragraph with:
These are the problems I’m accountable for at scale—across strategy, delivery, and measurable outcomes.

⸻

2) Cards (update titles + descriptions + keep icons)

Update the 5 cards to the following, in this exact order:
	1.	Engineering Velocity
Accelerating delivery through self-service CI/CD and platform automation
	2.	Developer Experience
Building self-service platforms engineers choose—not ones they’re forced to use
	3.	Unified Data Fabric
Consolidating enterprise data to enable reliable analytics and AI at scale
	4.	Revenue Systems Acceleration
Fixing broken GTM flows caused by fragmented CRM, data, and tooling
	5.	AI Governance
Making AI safe to ship in regulated environments—without slowing teams down

If card content is data-driven (array/map), update the data source accordingly. If it is hard-coded, update the JSX/TSX directly.

3) Metrics section

Rename the metrics section heading from Scope of Ownership to:
Heading: Scope of Impact
Update the subtitle to:
The surface area I’ve been accountable for.

Update metrics layout into two grouped blocks with group headers:

People & Orgs
	•	100+ Engineers Unlocked
	•	15+ Engineering Orgs Aligned

Systems & Business Impact
	•	20+ Enterprise Systems Consolidated
	•	$11B+ Revenue Pipeline Impact

Preserve the current visual style (icons, number emphasis, spacing). Ensure these groups stack vertically on mobile and appear as two columns on desktop if the layout supports it.

⸻

4) Quote block under metrics

Add a short quote block below the metrics (still within this section) that looks intentional and “executive.” Use a quote icon and include attribution. Use this exact copy for now:

Quote:
“Steven consistently took ownership of the hardest cross-org problems—especially where platform decisions directly impacted velocity and revenue outcomes.”
Attribution:
— Senior Engineering Leader

Style: slightly smaller than the section subtitle, italicized quote text, muted attribution, consistent with dark theme.

⸻

5) Acceptance criteria
	•	Updated copy appears on both desktop and mobile without overflow or clipping
	•	Cards render in the new order with updated titles/descriptions
	•	Metrics render as two grouped blocks with the exact labels above
	•	Quote block renders below the metrics and matches existing styling
	•	No TypeScript errors; build passes
