Goal: Replace the current “quote card” in the Impact at Scale section with a full-width quote band (no rounded card UI), aligned to the same grid as the metrics, with subtle divider lines, constrained text width for readability, and responsive behavior across viewports.

Requirements
	1.	Find the Impact at Scale section and locate the current quote “card” component/markup (likely a div with rounded corners/border/shadow).
	2.	Replace that quote card with a new component (or updated markup) named something like ImpactQuoteBand (or keep the existing component but change its structure/styles).
	3.	The quote band must:
	•	Span the full content width of the section container (same width as the metrics grid).
	•	Have no “card” look: remove rounded corners, heavy border, and strong background.
	•	Use a subtle band treatment:
	•	top and bottom hairline dividers (very low opacity)
	•	a very soft background wash/gradient (optional but subtle)
	•	Constrain quote text width to improve readability (target max-width: 60ch).
	•	Include a quote icon on the left (existing icon is fine), but keep it subtle.
	4.	Responsive layout
	•	Desktop/tablet: quote band is centered within the section container, text constrained, icon on left.
	•	Mobile: stack icon above text or keep icon inline but ensure padding is comfortable and text doesn’t feel cramped.
	5.	Maintain existing typography style (font family) but make quote feel premium:
	•	Quote text: slightly larger than body, italic optional but not required
	•	Attribution: smaller, muted, clearly separated (e.g., em dash prefix)
	6.	Ensure this doesn’t break dark theme contrast.

Implementation details (do this in code)
	•	Update the JSX/TSX for the quote area to this structure:
	•	A wrapper: div with class impactQuoteBand
	•	Inside: div with class impactQuoteInner
	•	Quote icon + content in a flex row:
	•	div.impactQuoteIcon
	•	blockquote.impactQuoteText (contains the quote)
	•	div.impactQuoteAttribution (contains attribution line)

CSS / Tailwind rules

Implement either Tailwind classes or CSS module styles (use whatever pattern the repo is already using). Use these design targets:
	•	Band container:
	•	width: 100%
	•	margin-top: 24px (or consistent spacing)
	•	padding: 20px 0 (band vertical padding)
	•	border-top: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08)
	•	border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.08)
	•	Optional subtle background wash:
	•	background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255,255,255,0.02), rgba(255,255,255,0.01), rgba(255,255,255,0.02))
	•	Inner layout:
	•	display: flex; gap: 16px; align-items: flex-start;
	•	Constrain text block:
	•	max-width: 60ch;
	•	Icon:
	•	low opacity (e.g., 0.35–0.5)
	•	Quote text:
	•	increase size slightly vs body
	•	line-height comfortable
	•	Attribution:
	•	smaller text
	•	muted color/opacity
	•	margin-top: 10–12px

Responsive rules
	•	At max-width: 640px:
	•	switch to column layout
	•	reduce padding
	•	keep max-width but allow full width if necessary

Acceptance Criteria
	•	Quote no longer appears as a “card” and instead reads as an editorial pull-quote band.
	•	Quote band aligns visually with metrics grid width.
	•	Quote text does not stretch uncomfortably wide on large screens.
	•	Mobile layout is readable, clean, and not cramped.
	•	No layout shifts or overflow issues.

Deliverables
	•	Update the quote markup/component in the Impact at Scale section.
	•	Add/update the corresponding CSS/Tailwind styles.
	•	Verify in Replit Preview at multiple widths (mobile + desktop) that it looks intentional and premium.
	•	Do not change copy/content unless required to move it into the new structure.
