Project brief

I want to rebuild my personal portfolio web app from scratch, using my current site as inspiration but not as a pixel-perfect template.

Current live site (for reference & inspiration):
https://portfolio-delta-one-k5vucu2gy1.vercel.app/

Please open that URL, study the structure, tone, and content, and then reimagine the UI/UX as if you are a senior design engineer building a polished, modern portfolio for a technical product & platform leader.

Goals

Reimagine the overall layout & visual design

Keep the spirit of the current app (AI, platforms, governance, GTM, experience timeline) but feel free to dramatically change the layout, spacing, navigation, and visual hierarchy.

Create something that feels like:

modern, premium SaaS / dev tools marketing site

but also a personal “executive portfolio” for a Principal/Director-level PM.

Keep the core concepts and content

Hero: governance, velocity, platform scale.

Sections: leadership principles, impact/experience timeline, interactive “Platform Value Multiplier,” AI Twin chat/assistant, contact / value-prop generator.

You can tighten copy and headings, but don’t remove the core ideas or achievements.

Make the UI feel more alive and interactive

Thoughtful motion: smooth entrance animations, subtle hover states, micro-interactions.

Strong typography, excellent spacing, clear breakpoint behavior from mobile → desktop.

Everything should feel intentional and cohesive, not just a pile of Tailwind classes.

Technical constraints

Use React + Tailwind CSS (Vite is fine as the build tool).

Keep the architecture simple: a single-page app with clearly separated components.

Preserve or re-create hooks/logic for:

The Platform Value Multiplier (sliders + calculated metrics).

The AI Twin chat widget (stubbed Gemini API calls are fine).

The Pitch / value prop generator (form → response section).

Use clean, idiomatic React with functional components and hooks.

Specific design asks
1. Hero section

Include a portrait area for me (placeholder image + alt text), ideally integrated into the hero:

Think: circular or rounded-corner portrait overlapping a gradient card, or a tasteful side column.

Portrait should support the executive/leader vibe without overpowering the headline.

Keep the core hero message:

Governance, velocity, platform scale.

Tagline about AI, platform engineering, and GTM enablement.

Add obvious primary CTAs:

“View Impact” (scroll to experience).

“Ask my AI Twin” or similar (opens chat or jumps to widget).

2. Platform Value Multiplier (PVM)

Treat this as a flagship interactive module, like a mini product inside the page.

Requirements:

Sliders for friction, fragmentation, and frontline users.

Real-time calculations for velocity, savings, and GTM impact.

Animated graphs/charts that update smoothly as sliders move:

Use simple visuals (animated bars, radial charts, or cards with number count-up).

Numbers should transition rather than jump.

Explain the math and earn trust:

Add a clear “How is this calculated?” affordance (icon/button).

This should open a modal or side panel explaining:

What each slider represents.

Formulas and assumptions behind each metric.

That numbers are directional, not forecasts.

Security & compliance:

Add a small, visually connected sub-panel or callout that shows:

Icons for shields/locks/compliance.

Short copy tying platform work to TCPA/CPRA, SOC 2, Responsible AI, etc.

It should visually say: “Yes, we care about speed, and about doing it safely.”

3. Experience / Impact timeline

Keep the content (Zillow, T-Mobile, AWS, etc.) but improve:

Timeline visuals (vertical line, milestones, badges).

Readability of “Key Outcome” bullets.

Make it feel like a polished case study timeline rather than plain cards.

4. AI Twin & contact

Keep the chat widget concept, but:

Refine the styling so it matches the rest of the site branding.

Ensure it’s unobtrusive on mobile (e.g., collapsible bubble).

Keep a contact / “talk to Steven” path:

Either via the chat (“I’d like to talk”) or a dedicated section with a simple contact form and clear reassurance copy.

5. Additional imagery

Create one or two intentional spots for optional supporting images:

For example:

A “systems thinking” visual near PVM.

A contextual image near the experience timeline.

These should be optional: when no image is provided, the layout should still look balanced.

UX & style direction

Visual style:

Dark theme is fine (inspired by the current site), but polish it:

Fewer colors, more consistency.

Thoughtful use of accent color(s) for CTAs and data.

Feels like a modern infra / AI platform site, not a generic portfolio.

UX priorities:

Clear reading flow for hiring managers and execs.

Easy scanning of impact metrics and roles.

Engaging but not overwhelming – animations should be subtle and purposeful.

Make sure it looks great on:

Small mobile screens (single column, tappable, no cramped sliders).

Large desktop monitors (good use of white/negative space).

Deliverables

A working React + Tailwind project with:

Clean component structure.

All sections wired up and responsive.

Placeholder portrait and image slots, with easy swap-out instructions in comments.

Please include brief comments where I should:

Insert my actual images.

Connect a real LLM / API key, if I choose to.
