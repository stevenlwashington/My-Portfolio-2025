Please consolidate the current “Scope of Impact” and “Executive Impact” sections into a single section immediately following “How I Drive Value”.

Goal

Remove redundancy by creating one consolidated section named “Impact at Scale” that contains:
	1.	a short framing line,
	2.	the grouped metrics, and
	3.	one executive-style validation quote with attribution.

Keep the page visually consistent with the current dark theme and make sure spacing and mobile responsiveness remain strong.

⸻

1) “How I Drive Value” section (ensure this content remains)

Confirm the section directly above the consolidated impact section uses:

Main Heading: How I Drive Value
Subtitle: These are the problems I’m accountable for at scale—across strategy, delivery, and measurable outcomes.

Cards in this exact order (titles + descriptions):
	1.	Engineering Velocity
Accelerating delivery through self-service CI/CD and platform automation
	2.	Developer Experience
Building self-service platforms engineers choose—not ones they’re forced to use
	3.	Unified Data Fabric
Consolidating enterprise data to enable reliable analytics and AI at scale
	4.	Revenue Systems Acceleration
Fixing broken GTM flows caused by fragmented CRM, data, and tooling
	5.	AI Governance
Making AI safe to ship in regulated environments—without slowing teams down

⸻

2) Create the consolidated section: “Impact at Scale”

Replace/remove the separate “Scope of Impact” and “Executive Impact” sections and implement a single combined section with:

Heading: Impact at Scale

Framing line (subtitle):
The scope and outcomes I’ve been accountable for across platform, data, and revenue systems.

⸻

3) Metrics (grouped layout)

Within “Impact at Scale”, render metrics as two grouped blocks:

People & Orgs
	•	100+ Engineers Unlocked
	•	15+ Engineering Orgs Aligned

Systems & Business Impact
	•	20+ Enterprise Systems Consolidated
	•	$11B+ Revenue Pipeline Impact

Requirements:
	•	Preserve the existing metric styling (large number emphasis, clean typography)
	•	On desktop: groups can be side-by-side if layout supports it
	•	On mobile: groups must stack vertically with good spacing

⸻

4) Quote block (validation)

Add a quote block directly below the metrics inside “Impact at Scale”.

Use this exact copy:

Quote:
“Steven consistently took ownership of the hardest cross-org problems—especially where platform decisions directly impacted velocity and revenue outcomes.”

Attribution:
— Senior Engineering Leader

Styling:
	•	Quote text italicized, slightly smaller than section heading
	•	Attribution muted
	•	Include a subtle quote icon if consistent with the design system

⸻

5) Acceptance Criteria
	•	Only one impact-oriented section exists after consolidation (“Impact at Scale”)
	•	No duplicate/repetitive “Scope” or “Executive Impact” sections remain
	•	Spacing looks intentional and not cramped (desktop + mobile)
	•	No TypeScript errors; build passes

Please list the exact files you changed (with paths) and paste the final updated component code for the consolidated section.
