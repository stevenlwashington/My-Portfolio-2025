As a recruiter, hiring manager, or executive evaluating Steven
I want to enter any company name and instantly receive a concise, leadership-level value proposition tailored to that organization
So that I can clearly understand how Steven’s platform, AI, and GTM experience aligns with my company’s strategy without reading a long or generic response.

Acceptance Criteria
1. Input & Output

User enters any company name into the input field.

When clicking Generate Value Prop, the app generates a 2–4 sentence output in a concise, executive tone.

Output must always reference:

Steven’s platform engineering + AI + GTM/RevOps strengths

Metrics or proof points (e.g., velocity, scale, impact)

A clear “why this matters to that company” angle

2. Tone & Style Requirements

Tone must match Steven’s brand:

Senior

Clear

Strategic

No tangents

No verbosity

No filler

Output should read like a VP-to-C-suite briefing.

3. Company Context Integration

The generation logic should:

Use any high-level knowledge about the company (industry, business model, domain focus).

If company context is unknown, the system must still generate a strong, generalizable value proposition.

Never hallucinate specifics or fake financials; it should infer strategic alignment themes, not fabricated details.

4. Structure of the Output

Every generated value prop must include:

Opening alignment statement
(e.g., “For <Company>, I bring…”)

Relevant core strengths
(platform modernization, AI governance, velocity, GTM tooling, data unification)

One or two quantified credibility anchors
(80% velocity lift, $1.6B+ revenue platform, 15k+ users, etc.)

Closing strategic outcome
(e.g., “helping your teams ship faster, safer, and with clearer insights.”)

5. Usability & UX

Generated text appears in a clean, readable card (same as current styling).

The card auto-expands if needed but maintains consistent spacing.

Include a subtle loading state during generation.

Ensure mobile responsiveness.

6. Technical Requirements

The component must accept any string as a company name.

Logic for generation is centralized for easier refinement.

Easily configurable: ability to adjust tone, length, or templates later.
