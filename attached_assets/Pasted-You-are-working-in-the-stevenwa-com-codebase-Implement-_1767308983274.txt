You are working in the stevenwa.com codebase. Implement Phase 1: remove the “View Case Study” deep-dive CTA from every Career card, in the LOWER (staging/dev) environment.

GOAL
- Remove the “View Case Study” button/link from all Career cards so the expanded in-place content (Strategic Questions + Outcomes + any modal/detail view you already have) becomes the canonical deep dive.
- The Career card should end cleanly after Outcomes/Key Metrics, without any additional deep-dive CTA.

SCOPE
- Career section only (all roles/cards).
- UI change is limited to removing this CTA and any related spacing; do NOT redesign the card layout.
- Do NOT add replacement CTAs (no “Learn more,” no “Read more,” no external links).

ANALYTICS (CRITICAL)
- Do NOT break the existing analytics stack.
- Keep existing expand/collapse tracking intact (questions/outcomes toggles).
- If there is a tracked event for “View Case Study,” remove the clickable element but do NOT modify shared analytics utilities or global event handlers.
  - If the event handler is specific to the removed CTA, delete only that handler wiring for the Career section to prevent dead listeners.
  - Do NOT change ids/data attributes used elsewhere.

ACCESSIBILITY + BEHAVIOR
- Ensure keyboard navigation/focus order remains correct after removing the CTA.
- No new animations; preserve reduced-motion behavior.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
1. Locate the Career card component(s) responsible for rendering the “View Case Study” CTA (button/link).
2. Remove rendering of that CTA for all cards (not just Zillow).
3. Remove any unused imports, props, or config entries that exist only to support “View Case Study.”
4. Adjust any bottom padding/margins so the card footer area looks intentional after CTA removal (minimal spacing only; keep design consistent).
5. Verify:
   - Career cards render without the CTA in both collapsed and expanded states
   - No console errors from missing handlers
   - Expand/collapse interactions still work and remain tracked
   - No other section of the site is impacted

DELIVERABLES
- List the files changed.
- Confirm the CTA is removed across all cards.
- Confirm expand/collapse tracking remains unchanged.
- Provide the staging/dev preview link or confirm the lower-environment deploy succeeded.
