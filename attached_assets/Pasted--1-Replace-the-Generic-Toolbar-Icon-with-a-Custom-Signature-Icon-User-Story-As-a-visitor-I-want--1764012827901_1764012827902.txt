✅ 1. Replace the Generic Toolbar Icon with a Custom Signature Icon
User Story

As a visitor, I want the top-left icon to reflect Steven’s professional identity so the site feels polished, intentional, and aligned with his platform + AI + engineering experience.

Acceptance Criteria

Replace the generic icon with a custom symbol representing Steven’s brand (options include: platform layers, cloud + signal, AI neural node, compass/star, or “S” monogram styled in tech aesthetic).

Icon must look premium, simple, and enterprise-grade—not cartoonish.

Clicking the icon scrolls smoothly to the top of the page.

Icon stays sharp in light/dark mode and remains crisp on retina displays.

Icon maintains correct padding and alignment with the name “Steven Washington.”

✅ 2. Redesign Executive Impact Section to Reduce Text + Add Visual Process Elements
User Story

As a recruiter or hiring manager, I want the Executive Impact section to be more visual and process-oriented so I can quickly understand how Steven thinks and executes as a platform product leader.

Acceptance Criteria

Keep the three high-impact metrics ($11B+, 80%, $5M) exactly as they are.

Replace the heavy text blocks with:

A visual process workflow showing Steven’s platform PM approach:

Discovery → Roadmapping → Governance → Build → Test → Launch → Measure → Improve

A simple diagram or infographic explaining how Steven solves platform problems.

Remove or heavily simplify:

“Domain Expertise”

“Platform Scale”

“Strategic Platform Capabilities”

All visuals must be digestible within 5–7 seconds.

Layout remains mobile-friendly and responsive.

✅ 3. Improve “Platform Value Multiplier” for Clarity + Tangibility
User Story

As a visitor exploring Steven’s platform philosophy, I want the Platform Value Multiplier to clearly show how sliders impact realistic business outcomes so the feature feels credible, intuitive, and meaningful.

Acceptance Criteria

Simplify sliders and rename them to clearer, real-world concepts (e.g., “Friction,” “Tooling Quality,” “Data Readiness,” “AI Maturity,” “Operational Overhead”).

Under each slider, include tooltip explanations of what the metric represents.

When sliders change, the result metrics:

Must update in a way that feels predictable, realistic, and causally connected.

Use ranges or bands instead of absolute numbers where appropriate.

Replace unclear calculations with a simple, transparent formula or logic summary:

e.g., “Lower friction → faster deployments → improved GTM productivity.”

Add small animated charts or micro-interactions that reinforce changes (optional but recommended).

Ensure no slider state produces unrealistic or nonsensical values.
