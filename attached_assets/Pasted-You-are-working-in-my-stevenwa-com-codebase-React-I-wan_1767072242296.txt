You are working in my stevenwa.com codebase (React). I want to redesign the “Career Trajectory & Impact” section cards so that:

GOAL
- Default view: show ONLY “Strategic Questions I asked” (questions-first), for scannability + credibility.
- Outcomes are hidden by default and revealed on user action (click/tap).
- Interaction must feel premium and consistent with the site (dark background, subtle borders, soft glow on hover).
- Must be responsive and accessible (keyboard + screen readers).
- Must preserve existing content and routing; only restructure the Career Trajectory cards.
- Must support my existing analytics stack (Cloudflare Web Analytics + Microsoft Clarity). Do NOT add new analytics vendors.

REQUIREMENTS
1) Card Structure (per role)
- Header row: Role title, Company name, Date range badge (keep existing).
- “Key outcomes” bullets should NOT show by default.
- Replace the two bullets with a section titled “Strategic questions I asked” containing 4 questions (from my chosen list below).
- Add a single “Show outcomes” control at bottom of the questions list that reveals the hidden outcomes section.
- When expanded, the control changes to “Hide outcomes”.
- Expanded section title: “Outcomes delivered” and show the existing bullet outcomes exactly as written today.

2) Interaction & UX (Option B)
- Desktop: card hover elevates slightly with subtle shadow/glow.
- Mobile: tap states feel responsive (no hover dependency).
- Expand/collapse must animate smoothly (height/opacity) and not cause layout jumpiness.
- Only one card expanded at a time (accordion behavior). Expanding a new one collapses the previous.
- Provide a “Expand all” / “Collapse all” toggle ABOVE the list (optional, only if it looks clean; otherwise skip).

3) Accessibility
- “Show outcomes” must be a <button> with aria-expanded, aria-controls.
- Outcomes region must have an id and be focusable when opened (optional but nice: move focus to the region).
- Keyboard: Enter/Space toggles; focus states visible.

4) Analytics-friendly instrumentation (NO new vendors)
- Add semantic data attributes to each toggle button:
  data-cta="reveal-outcomes"
  data-role="<slug>"   (e.g., zillow-platform-product-lead)
  data-company="<company>" (e.g., Zillow)
- On toggle open/close, fire a lightweight custom event IF window.clarity exists:
  window.clarity('event', 'reveal_outcomes_open', { role: slug, company })
  window.clarity('event', 'reveal_outcomes_close', { role: slug, company })
- If Clarity is not present, fail silently (no errors).
- Do NOT store cookies or add anything beyond this.

5) Content mapping (for the Zillow card shown in my screenshot)
- Replace Bullet #1 with these questions (use 4 total):
  1) How do we remove the biggest constraints that slow engineering down across teams?
  2) What would “self-service delivery” look like end-to-end for internal GTM engineering?
  3) Where are the highest-leverage automation opportunities in our developer workflow?
  4) How do we measure “speed” in a way leadership and engineers both trust?
- Replace Bullet #2 with these questions (use 4 total):
  1) What should we optimize for in platform TCO: cost, reliability, or team throughput—and when?
  2) What governance is essential for scale, and what governance creates drag?
  3) How do we enable responsible AI adoption without blocking teams from shipping?
  4) What is the cost of moving fast without governance—and the cost of governing too early?
- Keep the existing outcomes bullets available in the hidden “Outcomes delivered” section (unchanged text).

6) Visual design
- Keep the existing card styling language: dark surface, rounded corners, subtle border.
- The “Strategic questions” list should be highly readable:
  - slightly larger than body copy
  - good line-height
  - subtle numbering or bullet style that feels “product/strategy” (not bloggy)
- “Show outcomes →” should look like an inline CTA row at bottom:
  - not a giant button
  - include a chevron/arrow that rotates when expanded
  - entire row is clickable

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS
A) Locate the Career Trajectory & Impact section component(s) and the data model that powers these cards.
B) Refactor the card to support:
   - questions array (new)
   - outcomes array (existing bullets)
   - expanded state controlled by parent (accordion)
C) Implement animations using CSS (preferred) or a minimal helper; do not add heavy libraries.
D) Add the data-attributes + Clarity event firing on toggle.
E) Ensure it works on mobile preview and desktop.

DELIVERABLES
- Provide the code changes with file paths and a brief summary.
- Confirm the accordion behavior and Clarity event names.

DO NOT CHANGE
- Other sections of the homepage
- Global nav, hero, organizations logos, or contact form
- Existing outcomes bullet text
