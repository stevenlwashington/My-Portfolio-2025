You are working in my React + Vite + Tailwind portfolio site on Replit (dark theme). Implement the following UI/UX and content updates with clean, production-ready code. Keep styling consistent with existing components and do not introduce new design systems.

GOALS
1) Make the hero outcome explicit and improve CTA hierarchy.
2) Update “How I Drive Value” with an opinionated adoption-first platform statement + improved “Engineering Velocity” card copy.
3) Strengthen the “Impact at Scale” section as a proof wall (4 stat cards + improved quote).
4) Remove the homepage “Use Cases” section entirely (for now).
5) Compress Career Trajectory/Experience entries to 2 bullet highlights by default with an accessible inline accordion expand.
6) Add a clear footer CTA block (Schedule a call + Email me).
7) Fix alignment consistency: Hero can remain centered, all sections below are left-aligned within a consistent max-width container.

A) HERO
- Set the hero subheadline to EXACTLY:
  “I build internal platforms and AI-enabled systems that eliminate toil, accelerate delivery, and drive measurable business impact.”
- Replace hero CTAs with two buttons:
  Primary (solid): “Explore Impact”
  Secondary (outline/ghost): “Contact”
- “Explore Impact” should scroll to the “Impact at Scale” section via an anchor id (e.g., #impact).
- Desktop: buttons side-by-side. Mobile: stacked full-width with spacing.

B) HOW I DRIVE VALUE
- Replace the section intro line with EXACTLY:
  “Platforms win only when engineers choose them—adoption is earned, not mandated.”
- Keep the rest of the section unchanged.
- Update the “Engineering Velocity” card copy to be more strategic and holistic:
  - Update the card description to EXACTLY:
    “Accelerating delivery through self-service developer systems and platform automation.”
  - If the card title currently says “Engineering Velocity” or mentions “CI/CD” too prominently, adjust the title to be more strategic (keep it short) without making it feel like a new concept. Prefer something like:
    “Delivery Systems”
  - Ensure any remaining description text does not over-index on CI/CD tooling; emphasize systems, automation, and operational excellence.

C) IMPACT AT SCALE (PROOF WALL)
- Add an anchor id of “impact” to this section so the hero CTA scrolls here.
- Refactor to a 2x2 grid of stat cards on desktop; single column on mobile.
- Use these stats (same values):
  1) 100+ — Engineers Unlocked
  2) 15+ — Orgs Aligned
  3) 20+ — Enterprise Systems Consolidated
  4) $11B+ — Revenue Pipeline Impact
- Make the stat numbers significantly larger with a clear hierarchy:
  - Numbers: text-5xl on mobile, text-6xl on md+ with leading-none.
  - Labels: text-sm on mobile, text-base on md+.
- Keep the quote as a supporting element below the grid (less visually dominant than the stats).
- Replace the quote with this smoother version (EXACT):
  “Steven solved the cross-org constraints that limit velocity—aligning engineering systems, implementing AI and automation, and bringing execution rigor so teams shipped faster without trading off reliability.”
  — Senior Engineering Leader

D) USE CASES
- Remove the entire “Use Cases” section from the homepage for now.
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT create a new “Case Studies” section to replace it.
- If any nav links or anchors reference Use Cases / Case Studies, remove or repoint them so the homepage flow is clean and no CTA points to a missing section.

E) CAREER TRAJECTORY / EXPERIENCE
- For each role card:
  - Show role title, company, dates
  - Show ONLY the first 2 bullets by default
  - Add an accessible “Show more” accordion toggle to expand inline and reveal remaining bullets/details.
  - Toggle must use a button element and include aria-expanded.
- For any existing “View Case Study” link on the role cards, keep it, but ensure it is not duplicative/confusing with the accordion. If necessary, only show the “View Case Study” CTA inside the expanded area.
- Keep AWS logo behavior unchanged elsewhere (do not modify AWS logo assets/logic).

F) FOOTER CTA
- Add a CTA block above the final footer area:
  Headline: “Want to talk platforms, scale, or AI-driven systems?”
  Subtext: “If you’re hiring or exploring a partnership, I’m happy to share how I work and what I’ve shipped.”
  Buttons:
    Primary: “Schedule a call” (link placeholder; I’ll add Calendly later)
    Secondary: “Email me” (mailto link)
- Keep styling consistent with the dark theme, left-aligned.

G) ALIGNMENT CONSISTENCY
- Hero remains centered.
- All sections below use a consistent left-aligned container (same max-width).
- Normalize vertical spacing between sections.

OUTPUT
- Implement changes in code and ensure the app builds/runs without errors.
- Briefly list which files you changed and where I can edit the hero/section copy later (constants or component props).

Also — I need you to RELOCATE an existing section and update only one line of microcopy, while preserving all existing functionality, styling, spacing, logo rendering, monochrome/contrast look, and any animations.

Goal:
1) Move the existing section currently titled: "Organizations I've Worked With" so it appears immediately AFTER the "Impact at Scale" section on the homepage (same page).
2) Update the subtitle/microcopy under "Organizations I've Worked With" to exactly:
   "Through direct leadership roles and large-scale platform initiatives."
3) Do NOT change anything else about that section:
   - Keep all current logo sources and mappings (including any special-cased logo like AWS).
   - Keep the same layout, spacing, sizing, opacity/contrast, monochrome/gray styling, hover states, and responsiveness.
   - Keep any current accessibility attributes (alt text, aria-labels), and keep any existing scroll/animation behavior.
   - Do not refetch or replace logos; do not change file names; do not modify the folder structure for logos.

Implementation constraints:
- Only move the section in the render order of the homepage.
- Avoid rewriting/refactoring the section component; reuse the existing component as-is.
- If the section is inlined in a single page file, cut/paste the block without altering internal markup/classes (except the single subtitle text change).
- If the section is a separate component, move its invocation/location in the page layout without modifying internal component code (except the subtitle string prop/content change).
- Ensure the build passes with no TypeScript/ESLint errors.

Steps:
A) Locate the homepage file that composes these sections (likely src/pages/Home.tsx, src/pages/index.tsx, or similar).
B) Identify the component/block for "Impact at Scale" and the component/block for "Organizations I've Worked With".
C) Move the Organizations section to render immediately after Impact at Scale.
D) Update the subtitle line to the exact new copy.
E) Verify no visual regressions:
   - logos still render as monochrome/gray on the dark background
   - spacing remains consistent with the current layout
   - any responsive behavior remains the same
F) Provide a short summary of exactly what files you changed and what lines were updated.
