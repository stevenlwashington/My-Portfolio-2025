Goal: Update the homepage “closure / footer CTA” area so it no longer looks like a modular card panel. Make it feel like a clean, integrated end-of-page section. Primary CTA is “Schedule a call” (Calendly). Secondary CTA is “Send a note” (opens contact form). Add subtle hover/motion affordances. Preserve existing dark theme, typography, spacing system, and button styling language.

Scope:
- Homepage only (the closure CTA block above the footer).
- Preserve existing functionality and routing:
  - “Schedule a call” opens the existing Calendly experience/link currently used in the site.
  - “Send a note” opens the existing Contact Form (same action as current “Contact” CTA).
- Do NOT expose or reintroduce an email address anywhere.
- Do NOT add an email icon anywhere. If an email icon exists in the footer or elsewhere, remove it.

1) Remove the modular / card treatment (critical)
- Identify the closure CTA block that currently renders as a large rounded “card/panel” (distinct background rectangle, border, shadow, modular container feel).
- Refactor it into an integrated section:
  - Remove the outer card container border and heavy shadow.
  - Remove any “boxed” background that makes it look like a separate module.
  - Replace with:
    - A subtle top divider (1px hairline or gradient rule) that spans the content width (aligned to site max-width grid), not full viewport.
    - Optional ultra-subtle background wash behind the section (2–4% opacity) that does NOT read as a card.

2) Final copy (use exactly this)
- Heading: “Interested in how I approach platform engineering?”
- Subheading: “If you’re curious how I think about scale, adoption, and engineering systems, I’m happy to compare notes.”

3) CTA hierarchy (do not deviate)
- Primary button (filled / accent / most prominent): “Schedule a call”
  - Action: open existing Calendly scheduling flow/link (same behavior used elsewhere on the site).
- Secondary button (outline/ghost / less prominent): “Send a note”
  - Action: open the existing Contact Form (same behavior as “Contact”).
- Ensure labels are consistent site-wide:
  - If another CTA uses “Contact,” keep it there; for this closure area specifically, use “Send a note” (secondary) and wire it to the same contact form action.

4) Layout + responsiveness
- Desktop:
  - Left-align heading/subheading.
  - Buttons inline, primary first, spacing gap 12–16px.
  - Match max-width and section padding to other main sections.
- Mobile:
  - Center-align text.
  - Stack buttons vertically (primary “Schedule a call” on top, secondary beneath).
  - Buttons should be full-width or near-full width with comfortable spacing.

5) Subtle motion / hover affordances (respect reduced motion)
- Buttons:
  - Hover: slight lift (translateY(-1px)) + subtle glow/border emphasis consistent with your accent color
  - Active: return to translateY(0) with a very subtle press effect (scale 0.99)
  - Transition: 150–200ms ease
- Focus states:
  - Visible focus ring for keyboard navigation (don’t rely on color alone).
- prefers-reduced-motion:
  - Disable transforms; use only opacity/border/brightness changes.

6) Visual polish + “closure” feel
- Reduce vertical bulk so the section feels like the final beat before the footer (not another content card).
- Use typography hierarchy:
  - Heading high-contrast
  - Subheading subdued and shorter line-length for readability
- Ensure the section visually flows into the footer without a hard container edge.

Acceptance checks:
- The closure CTA no longer appears as a boxed card/panel.
- Primary CTA is clearly “Schedule a call” and opens Calendly.
- Secondary CTA is “Send a note” and opens the Contact Form.
- Desktop left-aligned; mobile centered + stacked.
- Hover/focus interactions work and reduced-motion is respected.
- No email icon or email address is exposed anywhere on the page.
