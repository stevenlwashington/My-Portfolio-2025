Goal
Fix the “Impact at Scale” quote layout on desktop so it no longer feels like a left-column orphan. The quote container should span the same full width as the metrics grid, but the quote text should be constrained to a readable measure (not full-line length). Mobile should remain stacked and natural.

Requirements (Locked)

Do not center the entire section or change overall page rhythm.

No new cards, no flashy treatments, no new CTAs.

Preserve existing colors, borders, shadows, and quote icon styling unless needed for spacing.

Mobile UI should remain effectively unchanged (quote remains full width).

No changes that break analytics tracking.

Implementation Instructions
1) Locate the “Impact at Scale” section

Find the component/markup that renders:

Heading: Impact at Scale

Metrics grid (4 metric tiles)

Quote/testimonial block underneath

2) Make the quote container span the same width as the metrics grid

Ensure the quote block wrapper uses the same container as the metrics grid.

The quote wrapper should be w-full within that container (i.e., it spans the grid width).

Important: The container should remain consistent with the section’s existing max-width (don’t invent a new outer container if one already exists).

3) Constrain the quote text measure inside the full-width quote container (desktop only)

Inside the quote block:

Add an inner wrapper around the quote text (and attribution) that constrains line length on desktop.

Target behavior

Desktop: text measure is ~68–74ch (readable, executive memo feel)

Mobile: text uses full width naturally (no harsh constraint)

Tailwind example approach

Quote container: w-full

Inner text wrapper: max-w-[72ch] on desktop only (e.g., lg:max-w-[72ch]), with w-full

4) Subtle desktop typography increase (quote only)

On desktop breakpoints only (e.g., lg:):

Increase quote font size by one step (subtle), e.g.:

from text-base → lg:text-lg (or equivalent in your system)

Adjust line height slightly if needed (e.g., lg:leading-relaxed) to keep it calm and readable

Do not change heading sizes or metric tile sizes.

5) Keep left alignment (do not center the quote block)

The full-width quote block stays aligned with the section content.

The inner text wrapper should be left-aligned within the quote container (default), not centered.

6) Spacing and rhythm

Maintain the current spacing between metrics grid and quote.

If the quote feels too separated, reduce the top margin slightly on desktop only (e.g., lg:mt-8 instead of lg:mt-10), but keep changes minimal.

Acceptance Criteria

Desktop: quote block spans the same width as the metrics grid; no “half-width orphan” appearance.

Desktop: quote text reads comfortably (not too wide), with a subtle presence increase.

Mobile: layout looks essentially the same as today.

Overall section feels integrated and composed, not card-heavy or marketing-y.

Notes for the Agent

Prefer reusing the existing container that wraps the metrics grid.

Implement the text measure constraint via an inner wrapper (not by shrinking the entire quote container).
