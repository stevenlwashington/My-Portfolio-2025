You are working in my stevenwa.com codebase (React + Vite). I need you to standardize alignment and layout so the homepage feels cohesive and professional on BOTH desktop and mobile.

GOAL
- All section headers and text content should be LEFT-aligned consistently across the entire homepage.
- Center alignment is allowed only for decorative visuals (hero rings/avatar background accents), not for readable text blocks.
- Ensure the layout is responsive and consistent in spacing and container widths.
- This needs to be production-ready (no regressions).

SCOPE
Homepage only (the main landing page). Do not change routing or copy unless required for alignment/layout.

REQUIREMENTS
1) Global layout container consistency
- Ensure all major sections share a consistent container width + horizontal padding:
  - Use a shared wrapper such as: max-w-6xl w-full mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8
- If the project already has a layout/container component or utility class, reuse it rather than inventing a new pattern.

2) Standardize section headers
- Implement a consistent SectionHeader pattern for all major sections:
  - Title (h2) left-aligned
  - Optional subtitle left-aligned
  - Optional CTA row left-aligned
- Normalize spacing:
  - Consistent top margin before header
  - Consistent gap between header and content

3) Eliminate mixed alignment
- Audit the homepage sections and remove any "text-center" or centered alignment applied to:
  - section titles
  - subtitles
  - paragraph blocks
  - lists
  - card content
  - metrics blocks
- Keep ONLY visual elements centered where appropriate (hero graphics, background flourishes).

4) Responsive behavior
- Ensure sections that use grids switch cleanly:
  - Desktop/tablet: multi-column
  - Mobile: single-column
- Maintain the same left edge alignment for text at all breakpoints.
- Ensure CTAs do not center on mobile; they should remain left-aligned or start-aligned.

5) Specific items to verify after changes
- Hero: headline/subhead left-aligned; decorative rings/avatar can remain visually centered.
- Impact at Scale: header left-aligned; metric grid aligned to container; quote band aligned to same container and left-aligned with constrained text width.
- Organizations I’ve Worked With: header/subhead left-aligned; logo strip remains as-is (monochrome/spacing preserved).
- Career Trajectory & Impact: section header + cards left-aligned; card internals left-aligned.
- Pre-footer CTA: left-aligned content and buttons.

6) Quality bar
- No visual regressions (spacing, typography, contrast, animation behavior).
- No TypeScript errors; build must pass.
- Test in Replit Preview at widths: ~390px, 768px, 1024px, 1440px.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement the alignment standardization in the minimal set of files.
- Provide a concise list of files changed and what alignment classes/styles were updated.

Proceed now.
