User Story: Clickable, Flippable Leadership Principle Cards

As a recruiter or hiring manager visiting Steven’s portfolio
I want the “Leadership Principles” cards (Responsible AI & Governance, Platform as a Product, Data as a Strategic Asset) to be concise by default and expandable on click
So that I can quickly scan his philosophy at a high level, and then dive deeper into details only for the cards that interest me.

Acceptance Criteria

Default (front) card state

Each card shows only:

Icon

Title (e.g., “Responsible AI & Governance”)

1 short supporting line (max ~15 words).

No long paragraphs are visible in the default state.

Cards are still arranged in the existing 3-column layout on desktop and stack cleanly on mobile.

Interactive “flip” behavior

Clicking (or tapping) a card flips it around to reveal the full text description.

The flip should feel smooth and intentional (e.g., 3D flip, rotateY, or tasteful fade/slide), not jarring.

Only one card can be “flipped”/expanded at a time; opening another card closes the previous one.

Back-of-card content (details view)

Back of the card shows:

The same title

The full current paragraph text (the long description you already wrote).

Include a clear “Back” / “↩ Close” affordance (button or icon) that flips the card back to the front.

Text remains readable with appropriate line height and contrast.

Usability & UX polish

Entire card is clickable, not just the text (with a clear hover state: subtle lift, border or shadow change).

On desktop:

Cards have a visible hover effect.

On mobile:

Taps work reliably without requiring precision.

Flip animation or transition is performant.

Accessibility

Cards are keyboard-focusable.

Pressing Enter or Space when a card is focused flips it.

Pressing Esc when a back side is visible flips it back to the front.

Use appropriate ARIA attributes (e.g., role="button", aria-expanded, aria-label or aria-describedby) so assistive tech understands the interactive nature.

Layout & responsiveness

Flipped state must preserve the card’s footprint so the layout doesn’t “jump” or push other content unpredictably.

On small screens, if a full flip is awkward, a graceful alternative is acceptable (e.g., card expands or fades into a “back” panel) as long as:

It’s consistent across all three cards.

It’s clear how to go “back”.

Implementation notes for Replit

Use React state per card to track isFlipped.

Use Tailwind for styling; a motion library (e.g., Framer Motion) is acceptable for the flip animation if available.

Keep the content (titles + long paragraphs) exactly the same; only change the interaction and layout.

You can paste this directly into Replit and say:
“Apply this user story to the three Leadership Principles cards on my portfolio page.”
