Goal
On desktop viewports, the quote block under Impact at Scale should no longer span the full section width. Instead, it should align to the same content column / grid width as the metrics cards, so the quote feels intentionally anchored and avoids excessive empty space. Mobile layout should remain unchanged.

Requirements (Do Not Deviate)

Mobile stays the same (stacked, full-width quote is OK).

Do not add new cards or modular wrappers.

Keep existing typography, colors, and quote icon styling unless required for alignment.

Respect prefers-reduced-motion (no new animations in this change).

Do not break analytics/event tracking.

Implementation Steps
1) Locate the Impact section and quote markup

Find the section with heading “Impact at Scale”

Inside it, identify:

the metrics grid wrapper (likely a 2x2 grid)

the quote/testimonial wrapper directly below it

2) Create a shared “content column” wrapper for desktop

Wrap the metrics grid + quote in a shared container that constrains width on desktop.

This wrapper should:

be width: 100% always

have a desktop-only max-width matching the metrics grid width

align with the left edge of the content column (or centered if your section is centered—match the metrics alignment)

If the metrics grid is already constrained, reuse that same container for the quote rather than introducing a second constraint.

3) Desktop-only CSS: constrain quote width to match the grid

On desktop breakpoints (e.g., min-width: 1024px or your existing lg: breakpoint):

Ensure the quote container uses the same width constraint as the metrics grid.

Remove any full-bleed behavior causing the quote to span the section width.

On mobile/tablet:

Leave quote full width as it is today.

4) Spacing and rhythm

Keep the current vertical spacing between:

metrics grid → quote

quote → next section

If the quote now feels too “floating,” add a very subtle top margin adjustment only (e.g., reduce by ~8–12px) so it feels integrated.

5) Verify behavior

Desktop (1440px): quote block aligns visually with metric cards; no excessive empty space.

Tablet (768px): no regressions.

Mobile (iPhone): no change.

Concrete Guidance (Use This Approach)

If you’re using Tailwind:

Create a wrapper like div className="mx-auto w-full max-w-[1100px]" (or whatever your metrics grid uses)

Put both the grid and the quote inside it

Ensure the outer section background still spans full width (do not constrain the entire section—only the content)

If CSS modules:

Add a .contentColumn class with desktop max-width + margin: 0 auto;

Apply it to the wrapper around grid + quote

Important: Match the grid’s existing max-width. Do not invent a new width if one already exists.

Acceptance Criteria

On desktop, the quote block’s left/right edges align with the metrics grid edges.

The quote container no longer spans the entire section width.

Mobile appearance is unchanged.

No new “card” look is introduced—this remains integrated and calm.
