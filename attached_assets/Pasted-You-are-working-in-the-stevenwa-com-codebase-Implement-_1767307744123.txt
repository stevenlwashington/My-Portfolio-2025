You are working in the stevenwa.com codebase. Implement the updated Career section copy in a LOWER environment (staging/dev), without changing the established design system decisions.

SCOPE
- Update text content ONLY for the Career cards:
  - Leadership Thesis (1 sentence)
  - Section label (locked): "Strategic Questions That Guided My Work"
  - Three role-specific strategic questions per card
  - Outcomes (shown on expand/reveal)
- Do NOT change layout structure, card styling, spacing, or the expand/collapse interaction patterns.
- Do NOT introduce modular/boxed UI treatments beyond what exists today.
- Do NOT change CTA hierarchy anywhere on the site.
- Do NOT expose any email addresses.

ANALYTICS + INTERACTION (CRITICAL)
- Preserve existing analytics tracking:
  - Do not rename element ids, data attributes, event names, or handler functions.
  - Keep the same click targets for expand/collapse and any “View case study” links if present.
- Ensure expand/reveal behavior remains lightweight and deliberate (no new animations).
- Respect reduced-motion preferences (no new transforms/animations).
